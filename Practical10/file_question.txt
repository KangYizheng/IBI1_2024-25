Row:
from 47 to 57 rows

Discussion:
Rwanda may be facing a higher prevalence of multiple serious diseases. 
For example, AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, etc., which can be severe in Rwanda, cause substantial 
life years lost and disability, thereby driving up DALYs rates. In contrast, other countries may 
have been more successful in preventing and controlling diseases with lower morbidity and 
mortality rates, so DALYs rates have not reached the levels seen in Rwanda.
